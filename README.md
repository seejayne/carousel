##Carousel
Here's the Carousel prototype. It's pretty cool.

####How many hours did it take to complete?
7 hours for basic functionality + 7 hours for the optional extras. Spent a long time tweaking and playing with that intro animation. 

####Which required and optional stories have you completed?
- Completed all the required stories
- Optional: Photo tiles move with scrolling
- Optional: Tapping in the form reveals the keyboard and shifts the scrollview and "Create a Dropbox" button up.
- Optional: Tapping the Agree to Terms checkbox selects the checkbox.
- Optional: Tapping on Terms shows a webview with the terms.
- Optional: User is taken to the tutorial screens upon tapping the "Create a Dropbox" button.
- Optional: User can page between the screens with updated dots
- Optional: Upon reaching the 4th page, hide the dots and show the "Take Carousel for a Spin" button.

- Couldn't figure out "When the keyboard is visible, if the user pulls down on the scrollview, it will dismiss the keyboard."
- Didn't get to the Optional "Learn More" section
